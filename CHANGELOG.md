# Changelog

All notable changes to Quant are documented here.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Evidence-Backed Signal Desk with numbered source and quality indicators for deterministic signals, chart data, historical strategy checks, earnings, and valuation.
- Local Decision Journal for saving thesis, catalyst, invalidation, lifecycle status, notes, and the exact signal and risk snapshot used for a decision.
- Transactional journal persistence in Electron local app data.
- Verified Quant AI harness with isolated analyst and verifier contexts followed by a bounded final orchestrator.
- Harness trace UI with worker outcomes, timing, evidence ledger, validation results, and failure attribution.
- Deterministic evidence-ledger tests.

### Changed

- Quant AI responses now use numbered evidence citations and exact Decision, Evidence, Invalidation, and Risk sections.
- Model responses are checked for structural completeness, valid evidence IDs, and prohibited certainty language, with at most one constrained repair.
- News headlines and pasted material are explicitly treated as untrusted evidence rather than model instructions.
- Multi-pass model analysis now runs only when requested instead of automatically when a chart opens.
- The default local model identifier is `gemma-4-e4b-it`, matching the supported llama.cpp runtime.
- Local AI copy now describes a verified decision memo instead of implying an unrestricted autonomous agent.

### Reliability

- Analyst failure falls back to a deterministic memo.
- Verifier failure is recorded without discarding a valid analyst result.
- Orchestrator failure returns the analyst draft with explicit failure metadata.
- Journal writes use a temporary file and atomic rename to reduce corruption risk.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Signal Board scanner for end-of-day technical setups across the bundled U.S. stock universe, watchlist, and ETF holdings.
- Deterministic signal scoring, setup classification, risk plans, and historical strategy summaries.
- macOS arm64 and Windows x64 release archives published as GitHub Release assets.
